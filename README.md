## **Description**
This Chatbot was built with Google Gemini (gemini-2.0-flash), enabling users to interactively estimate the total amount of paint and the number of 20L buckets required for large-scale painting projects through natural conversation.

The chatbot collects the following inputs from users:
1. Number of buildings
2. Painting scope (interior, exterior, or both)
3. Average floor area per building
4. Average number of floors
5. Number of paint coats

Based on these parameters, the chatbot performs an accurate calculation of the total paintable surface area and paint volume needed.

Additionally, the AI model incorporates 2 important factors:

- Non-paintable areas such as doors and windows, estimated at **12% of the total surface area**

- Paint loss and wastage, estimated at **5% of paint required.**

For estimation purposes, the chatbot assumes an average paint coverage of 10 mÂ² per litre, and uses 20-litre paint buckets, which are the standard capacity for large construction projects.
